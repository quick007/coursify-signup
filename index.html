    <p>We created Coursify to offer a fresh and innovative learning experience. Traditional LMS systems such as Schoology have become stagnant, failing to adapt to the evolving needs of learners and educators. Hence, we've dedicated our expertise to creating something new and different: a platform that puts the user experience first and allows for true engagement and collaboration.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">And don't just take our word for it - we've compiled a list of common issues with Schoology that we believe are holding back the learning experience. Check them out for yourself and see why we're passionate about creating something better.</p>
